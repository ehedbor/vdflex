    /// Traditional KeyValues implementations require that all data is stored in a root-level
    /// object with exactly one key. This library also assumes this to be the case. However,
    /// certain KeyValue-like formats DO permit the root object to have multiple keysâ€”namely,
    /// the VMF (Valve map file) format. To allow the library to handle these formats, two families
    /// of ser/de functions are provided: *key-value functions* and *value functions*.

    /// operate on a single key-value pair. They are mainly intended for serializing and 
    /// deserializing KeyValues files.

    /// as well as incomplete files.
