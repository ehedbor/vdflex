    /// 
    /// # Explanation
    /// 
    /// Traditional KeyValues implementations require that all data is stored in a root-level
    /// object with exactly one key. This library also assumes this to be the case. However,
    /// certain KeyValue-like formats DO permit the root object to have multiple keysâ€”namely,
    /// the VMF (Valve map file) format. To allow the library to handle these formats, two families
    /// of ser/de functions are provided: *key-value functions* and *value functions*.
    ///
    /// Key-value functions like [`crate::kv_to_string`] and `crate::kv_from_string`
    /// operate on a single key-value pair. They are mainly intended for serializing and
    /// deserializing KeyValues files.
    /// 
    /// Value functions like [`crate::to_string`] and `crate::from_string` handle values
    /// directly, with no enclosing object. These functions can handle multiple root level keys,
    /// as well as incomplete files.
    /// 
    /// This error occurs when attempting to deserialize a file that contains multiple root-level
    /// keys with a value function. When this happens, either the file was malformed or you should 
    /// have used a value function.

    /// Indicates that an unrepresentable sequence was serialized.
    /// 
    /// # Explanation
    ///
    /// There are two cases in which sequences cannot be serialized. The first occurs when a
    /// top-level sequence is serialized, like so:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use vdflex::error::Error;
    /// # use vdflex::ser::to_string;
    /// let nums = [1, 2, 3];
    /// // println!(to_string(&nums).unwrap()); // panics
    /// # assert!(matches!(to_string(&nums), Err(Error::UnrepresentableSequence)));
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The second case happens when a nested sequence is serialized:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use vdflex::error::Error;
    /// # use vdflex::ser::to_string;
    /// let nested = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];
    /// // println!(to_string(&nested).unwrap()); // panics
    /// # assert!(matches!(to_string(&nested), Err(Error::UnrepresentableSequence)));
    /// ```
    ///
    /// These errors both have the same root cause: the representation of sequences in KeyValues.
    /// In short, sequences are represented by repeating the parent element's key for each value
    /// in the sequence.
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use indoc::indoc;
    /// # use vdflex::ser::{to_string, kv_to_string};
    /// #[derive(serde::Serialize)]
    /// struct Data { nums: Vec<i32> }
    /// 
    /// let data = Data { nums: vec![1, 2, 3] };
    /// println!("{}", kv_to_string("Data", &data).unwrap());
    /// // This prints the following:
    /// // Data
    /// // {
    /// //     "nums" "1"
    /// //     "nums" "2"
    /// //     "nums" "3"
    /// // }
    /// # assert_eq!(
    /// #    to_string(&data).unwrap(),
    /// #    indoc! {r#"
